# MYFIRSTPROJECT
This is a very simple program to have a watchlist, historical data and performance of ADS (American Depositary Shares)
At this momment the Table of Stocks for the watchlist in the program are just from Argentinians ADS also called CEDEARS. Anyways, you can check the performance of any ADS and it's historical data due to this program have two main functions (watchlist, and performance)

I started programming in August 2021 so this script for sure can be veery simple and being a bit of  inefficient
